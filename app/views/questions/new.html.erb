<h1>New Question</h1>


<%# form_for is a Rails built-in form helper which generates a form that integrates nicely with a matching controller (in this cause questions_controller.
  Case 1: if @question is not persisted (not yet saved to the database), then form_for will make the form send a `POST` request to `questions_path` which should be defined to submit to questions controller / create action.
  Also, if you have any attributes pre-set on any of the @question fields (such as title or body). it will pre-populate ethose fields.
  One more thing, it will also add a special class if there happens to be errors on a specific field.
  %>


<%# this will look for a partial names `_form.html.erb` within the same folder as this file.
    If you want to render the partial from another folder, you can use the full path such as: render "/questions/form"
    Partials have access to the instance variables available in the template. So in this case, @question will be available in _form.html.erb
    If you want to pass a local variable to the partial, then you can do:
      = render "form", abc: "Hello"
    Then you will have a variable named `abc` available in `_form` with value "Hello"
%>

<%= render "form" %>
